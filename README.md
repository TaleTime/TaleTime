TaleTime is an innovative app for Android and iOS, that lets children experience a new unique way of listening to audiobooks.

Besides our professionally recorded audiobooks we also give parents the opportunity to record the stories themselves. Recording is very convenient and of course can be done without extensive technical know-how. TaleTime also offers children the opportunity to influence the course of the stories themselves.

## Write a new Story

TaleTime relies on writers writing stories! If you want to contribute, the following information is for you.

The the open-source tool *[Twine](http://twinery.org)* is used to create stories. *[Here](https://twinery.org/wiki/twine2:guide)* you can find a useful tutorial in case you don't know Twine yet.
After finishing the .twine file the *[twine converter](https://github.com/TaleTime/Converter)* is used to receive a .json file, which is then used by the actual TaleTime app.
